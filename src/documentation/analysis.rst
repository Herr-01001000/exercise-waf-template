Test_update
===========

.. automodule:: src.analysis.test_update
    :members:

We put this part into analysis for the reason that test_update function is used to analyze the update function with real dataset. Moreover, it is also an analysis for observing whether the update function works properly.

Timing
======

We put timing into analysis since this function is used as an analysis for how fast the function of fast_batch_update can be.
